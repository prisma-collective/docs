Each place has its own essence, its own uniqueness of expression, its own unique environment. It is an alive, never-static, ever-changing field of entanglements that continuously expresses itself sometimes silently sometimes with a roar. David Seamon writes that a sense of place can be “described as the specific character, atmosphere, and expressive energy of a particular environment or locale.” This sense of place shapes human relationships and interactions, shapes its communities and the larger society. A sense of place has a twofold movement between the spirit of place, that which a particular environment emanates, its singular qualities of such landscape to the experiencer, and a sense of place which brings in the sensibility that radiates from the person towards the place. It's in a relationship, it is within the experiencer that the essence of place expresses itself to us, humans. Different dimensions of the soul become alive when we dive into place. We are oblivious of the potentiality that lies within this relationship, its own unique expression in us can only foresee the future possibilities of interconnected value that will appear.
