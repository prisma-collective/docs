[places](places) are complex systems: dynamic, adaptive, evolving. places are also not just complex systems but living systems, with essence. seeing the potential of a place means seeing into what the essence of this place is and what it wants to become to actualise its fullest expression. 

this work entails aligning multiple stakeholders, across public, private and civilian levels of society, around a common purpose. 

aligned action is taken to materialise that potential, bringing the system forwards.
