ground-potentialising is the process of developing the image, and articulation, communication etc, of a future event. this can be a simple event page. this can also be a wiki detailing a methodology to be trialled, as a kind of validation or for developmental purposes. events are suitable to any communities seeking to grow capacities for sel-organising in response to changing environmental conditions.
