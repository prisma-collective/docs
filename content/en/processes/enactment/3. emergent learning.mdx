## Collective emergence of sense of place  
Each participant has its own unique relationship with [place](/glossary/Place.md), its own identitarian emergence to its own perception. If we want to more fully understand the wholeness of a place, it is important to share it with the group or community you are working with. Each participant is like an organ of perception that resonates with the place as a whole.  By creating the space for participants to bring what they wrote about the place as a collective the group can see the patterns and themes and qualities unique to that place. 

1. Create a safe space where each participant brings their perceptions of the place as a whole.

2. Through careful and collective listening the group can elucidate the patterns, themes and qualities unique to that sense of place. 

3. The group will, collectively, build an image, a representation of the sense of place.

## Emergent Learning of Place
An emergent table will help the group or community learn about a pattern or theme that has come up through the sense of place exploration. It's a learning methodology that is weaved with the local reality of place and will empower developers to explore possibilities of solutions to current challenges.

The main driving question is of key importance to focus the learning where it needs to go. Each quadrant evolves the learning and exploration face to higher levels of understanding.
