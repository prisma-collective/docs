**DirectED Abuja Hub**
---

The DirectED Abuja Hub is a community-of-place within the DirectEd ecosystem. It brings together builders, innovators, and learners across Abuja and the wider Nigerian tech landscape. The hub is home to multiple active teams exploring challenges across education, digital identity, health innovation, culture-tech, community coordination, and civic technology.

We operate through structured collaboration, weekly learning rhythms, transparent documentation, and peer-driven exploration. Our work aligns with DirectEd’s principles of decentralized coordination, autonomy, and shared learning.

• Support teams working on real problems grounded in Nigerian contexts.
• Create an environment for discovery, experimentation, and responsible innovation.
• Document local insights for global learning across the DirectEd network.
