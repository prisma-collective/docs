# Hubs
hubs are on-the-ground, physical spaces, which will be identified by a local changemaker or identify themselves as the host of the event. that's the way that the whole onboarding process becomes activated and other stakeholders organise around that. hubs enable the process of co-design. trust cannot be rushed. hubs may take the form of...

- community centres
- bioregional learning centres
- in-person DAOs
- cooperatives/ hosts of cooperative collectives
- co-living and co-working spaces that actively play a stewarding role in their region
- living labs

# Hub onboarding
hub onboarding covers all the steps necessary to become capable of self-organising an ALJ and self-publishing an ALJ [case-study](/patterns/case-study.md). we are currently aiming for reaching that level of capability with a single ALJ. that means that by the end of the first ALJ, hub teams are capable of... 

- developing their own [Core Processes](/processes)
- developing and integrating their own [publishing](/processes/process-infrastructuring/publishing.md) stack 
- actively participating in future prisma action-learning developments

The images below build up a picture of one of many ways to hold together the different parts of an [action-learning journey](action-learning journey) from the perspective of the hubs. 

The participant onboarding process starts *early*. A long facilitated onboarding process is required to align all the different stakeholders involved in an [ALJ](ALJ). Before participant onboarding even begins, there's a short period where the hub team and core facilitation team (prisma) can align on the aims of the ALJ and the purpose of approaching organising a transformation-focussed event in this way. 

There are three levels of outcomes that an [ALJ](ALJ) can aim for, detailed in [home](/). 

The prisma core facilitator team is actively facilitating the organising of the first ALJ, from start to completion of the intensive at the end. The process of organising a hub's first ALJ is also a process of onboarding the hub into ALJ organising and case-study publishing capabilities. By the end of the first ALJ, we aim for the hub to be able to organise its next ALJ with minimal/ intermittent support by prisma.

In the process of organising an ALJ, several form of data are generated, which become the content of the [case-study](/patterns/case-study.md) published. 
# Benefits of an ALJ
Here's a brief overview of some of the main benefits accessible to hubs and related stakeholders by participating in the organising of an [action-learning journey](action-learning journey).

- Stewarding the evolution of [place](/glossary/Place.md)-unique systems-change [practices](/practices) that serve the vitality and capabilities of their communities
- Showcasing local talent and product innovation.
- Demonstrating community needs being met.
- Potential for attracting investment and/or embarking on further learning journeys.
- Ability to invoice for organizing efforts
- Growing reputation and impact locally
- Keeping local talent local, investing in local innovation ecosystems
- Focussing on real needs in the surrounding community and the fulfilment that comes with working at a relatable level of impact
- Grow individuals that are solution and potential oriented
- Publishing [case-studies](/patterns/case-study.md), which aim to serve two purposes:
	1. Attracting fellow change-makers who would like to subscribe to co-learn on the action-learning, in the process becoming an income generator that can support the sustainability of the hub activities
	2. Engaging external stakeholders (for possible support)
