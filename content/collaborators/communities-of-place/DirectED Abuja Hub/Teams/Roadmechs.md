## Project Overview

### Problem Statement

Across Nigerian highways and inner roads, it is common to find a driver stranded by the roadside  not by choice, but by sudden vehicle breakdown.

In these moments, several risks immediately arise:

- No access to trusted mechanics, especially in unfamiliar or remote locations  
      
    
- Long waiting times due to uncertainty about who to call  
      
    
- Direct economic loss from delayed travel, missed work, or spoiled goods  
      
    
- Personal safety risks, particularly at night or in isolated areas  
      
    

The driver is often forced to rely on:

- Random passersby  
      
    
- Trial-and-error roadside help  
      
    
- Or unverified mechanics with no guarantee of skill or safety  
      
    

The core problem is clear:

There is no trusted, real-time system that connects stranded drivers to verified mechanics nearby.

  

### Solution Summary

Roadmechs is a location-based roadside assistance platform that connects drivers instantly to the nearest trusted and skilled mechanics in their area.

When a breakdown occurs:

- The driver opens Roadmechs  
      
    
- The system identifies nearby available mechanics  
      
    
- The driver is connected directly to a verified professional  
      
    
- The vehicle is fixed faster, safer, and with greater confidence  
      
    

In simple terms:

Roadmechs turns roadside panic into structured, on-demand mechanical support.

  

## Strategic Value

Roadmechs directly solves three major roadside challenges at once:

1. Time Waste → Instant Connection  
    Drivers no longer waste hours searching for help.  
      
    
2. Unverified Help → Trusted Mechanics  
    Only skilled and trusted mechanics are connected to users.  
      
    
3. Safety Risk → Controlled Response  
    Drivers are no longer left stranded without protection or guidance.  
      
    

## Target Users

- Daily commuters  
      
    
- Intercity travelers  
      
    
- Commercial drivers  
      
    
- Logistics operators  
      
    
- Ride-hailing drivers  
      
    
- Anyone at risk of roadside breakdown  
      
    

## Impact Vision

Roadmechs creates a future where:

- No driver is left helpless by the roadside  
      
    
- Mechanical help is as accessible as a phone tap  
      
    
- Breakdown response becomes faster, safer, and economically efficient  
      
    
- Roadside repairs move from randomness to structured service delivery
