## Project Overview

### Problem Statement

Nigeria’s STEM research ecosystem suffers from a structural trust crisis that affects every stage of funding:

1. Opacity  
    Donors, institutions, and stakeholders cannot verify how research funds are utilized. Reports are delayed, incomplete, or unverifiable.  
      
    
2. Delays  
    Bureaucratic processing timelines of 6–18 months slow down experimentation, destroy momentum, and prevent researchers from accessing time-sensitive resources.  
      
    
3. Trust Deficit  
    Because outcomes are not transparently verifiable, donors reduce funding, researchers lose opportunities, and innovation stalls.  
      
    

Behind all these issues is the same core breakdown:

Research funding is managed in black boxes rather than transparent, accountable systems.

### Solution Summary

StemTrust introduces a blockchain-powered, milestone-based funding platform that restores trust, transparency, and speed to STEM research in Nigeria.

The platform is built around three key mechanisms:

### 1. Smart Lock (Blockchain Escrow)

Funding does not go into personal accounts.  
It is locked securely in smart contracts, eliminating misallocation risks and ensuring funds are always traceable.

### 2. Milestone-Based Release

Researchers receive funds only when they provide verifiable progress evidence:

- Photos  
      
    
- Data  
      
    
- Logs  
      
    
- Research outputs  
      
    

A 75% approval vote from the funder or participating community triggers the next release.

This ensures every disbursement is tied to real work — not paperwork or bureaucratic approvals.

### 3. Direct Access, No Bottlenecks

StemTrust connects donors directly to verified researchers, bypassing months of middle-layer administrative delay.  
This accelerates research timelines and gives funders confidence through real-time proof of progress.

## Technical Infrastructure

StemTrust is built with:

- React for the frontend interface  
      
    
- Node.js for backend APIs and workflow automation  
      
    
- Cardano / MeshSDK / Aiken for blockchain logic, milestone validation, and smart contract implementation  
      
    

This stack ensures:

- Transparency  
      
    
- Security  
      
    
- Auditability  
      
    
- Scalability for nationwide research programs

## Strategic Value Proposition

StemTrust directly addresses Nigeria’s most persistent research funding challenges by transforming:

- Research transparency → into verifiable digital evidence  
      
    
- Disbursement delays → into milestone-triggered automation  
      
    
- Donor distrust → into a transparent, community-auditable process  
      
    

The outcome is a funding ecosystem where:

- Researchers receive support fast  
      
    
- Donors see exactly what they paid for  
      
    
- Innovation accelerates rather than stagnates  
      
    

StemTrust turns STEM research funding from a high-risk gamble into a verifiable, data-backed investment.
