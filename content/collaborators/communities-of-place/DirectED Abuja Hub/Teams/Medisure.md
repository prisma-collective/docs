## Project Overview

### Problem Statement

In Abuja, counterfeit and substandard medicines circulate daily through opaque supply chains, unreliable distributors, and unregulated street vendors.

From our community exploration, we discovered that:

- Patients cannot confidently verify if their drugs are genuine  
      
    
- Pharmacists struggle to trace the true source of medicine batches  
      
    
- Doctors have no secure way to enforce prescription-only access  
      
    
- The result is treatment failure, drug resistance, preventable deaths, and public distrust in healthcare  
      
    

This is not just a logistics problem  it is a life-and-death trust failure inside Nigeria’s medicine ecosystem.

  

### Solution Summary

MediSure is a Cardano-powered medicine verification and prescription management system designed to restore trust, safety, and transparency in drug distribution.

How it works:

- Medicine batches are minted as unique on-chain assets on Cardano  
      
    
- QR codes are generated for each batch  
      
    
- Pharmacies and distributors update the blockchain as drugs move through the supply chain  
      
    
- Patients scan QR codes to instantly verify authenticity  
      
    
- Doctors issue secure digital prescriptions, ensuring controlled access to sensitive drugs  
      
    

Every step  from manufacturer to patient  becomes immutable, verifiable, and tamper-proof.

  

### Target Community

Primary Users:

- Patients in Abuja communities  
      
    
- Licensed pharmacists and drug distributors  
      
    
- Medical doctors and clinics  
      
    
- Public health regulators  
      
    

Why This Matters in the Nigerian Context:

- Fake drugs thrive where verification is weak  
      
    
- Street vending undercuts regulated pharmacies  
      
    
- Drug resistance increases national health costs  
      
    
- Public trust in healthcare continues to erode  
      
    

MediSure directly responds to the community’s demand for trust, transparency, and safety in everyday healthcare decisions.
