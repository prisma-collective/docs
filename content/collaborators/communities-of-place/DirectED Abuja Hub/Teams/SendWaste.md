## Project Overview

### Problem Statement

Urban Nigeria generates over 32 million tonnes of waste every year, yet more than 70% of recyclable value is lost to open dumps, illegal burning, and blocked drainages.

The deeper crisis is trust and verification:

- Waste collectors work daily but cannot prove what they recover to banks or recyclers.  
      
    
- Residents pay for waste services without proof of proper disposal.  
      
    
- Government and corporate waste contracts rely on estimates, not verifiable recovery data.  
      
    

The result is a broken loop:  
Hard work exists but proof does not. Value exists  but trust does not.

  

### Solution Summary

SendWaste Cardano is a blockchain-powered waste recovery verification platform that creates tamper-proof proof of work for every waste collection event.

Each verified recovery includes:

- Photo + GPS verification  
      
    
- NFT receipt minted on Cardano  
      
    
- Timestamped, geofenced recovery record  
      
    
- Automated WASTE token rewards  
      
    
- Real-time ESG and material flow tracking  
      
    

This transforms waste from an unverified activity into a bankable, traceable, and rewarding economic system.

  

### Target Community

Primary Users:

- Informal waste collectors in Abuja (Kubwa, Gwarimpa, Dutse, Lugbe)  
      
    
- Low-income households needing verified service delivery  
      
    
- Recycling businesses suffering from unstable material supply  
      
    
- ESG-driven companies and public institutions needing real impact data  
      
    

Why This Matters in the Nigerian Context:

- Blocked drains → flooding → disease outbreaks  
      
    
- Youth unemployment → waste recovery becomes verified income  
      
    
- No credit history → collectors remain financially excluded  
      
    
- ESG budgets rising → but unverifiable data destroys trust  
      
    

SendWaste restores trust by making every recovery event provable, every collector bank-visible, and every ton of waste digitally accountable.
