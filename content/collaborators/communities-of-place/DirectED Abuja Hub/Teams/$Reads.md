## Project Overview

### Problem Statement

Across many Nigerian communities, students struggle with three connected barriers:

1. Low motivation to study consistently  
      
    
2. High cost of exam registration and preparation  
      
    
3. Limited access to reliable digital learning tools, especially offline  
      
    

Even when students are willing to learn, the system offers:

- No direct incentive for daily study habits  
      
    
- No easy verification of learning outcomes  
      
    
- No simple way to convert academic effort into financial support for exam access  
      
    

Learning becomes effort without reward and many students fall out of the system not because they lack ability, but because the system does not sustain them.

  

### Solution Summary

READS transforms education into a Learn-to-Earn experience.

Students are rewarded with blockchain tokens for:

- Studying learning materials  
      
    
- Completing quizzes  
      
    
- Passing Computer-Based Test (CBT) simulations  
      
    

READS also provides:

- Full CBT practice environment  
      
    
- Verifiable on-chain academic certificates  
      
    
- Integrated exam-fee payment support  
      
    
- Digital learning marketplace  
      
    
- USSD access for offline and low-connectivity users  
      
    

This creates a closed educational economy where effort, achievement, certification, and access to exams are structurally connected.

  

## Core System Structure

READS operates across four tightly linked layers:

1. Learn Layer  
    Students study digital content and prepare using CBT-style practice questions.  
      
    
2. Test Layer  
    Quizzes and CBT simulations measure real understanding, not guesswork.  
      
    
3. Earn Layer  
    Smart contracts reward verified performance with blockchain tokens.  
      
    
4. Access Layer  
    Tokens can be used for:  
      
    

- Paying exam registration fees  
      
    
- Accessing educational tools  
      
    
- Participating in the digital marketplace  
      
    

For users without smartphones or internet:

- USSD access ensures inclusion, removing connectivity as a barrier to education.  
      
    

  

## Strategic Value

READS is not only an EdTech platform it is a behavior-shaping infrastructure that:

- Converts educational discipline into economic value  
      
    
- Links academic effort directly to exam access  
      
    
- Uses blockchain for trust, auditability, and reward transparency  
      
    
- Extends education access through offline USSD inclusion  
      
    

This directly addresses:

- Student dropout caused by exam fees  
      
    
- Inconsistent study habits  
      
    
- Lack of verifiable academic micro-credentials  
      
    
- Digital exclusion in low-connectivity regions  
      
    

## Impact Vision

READS creates a future where:

- Students earn their way into opportunity  
      
    
- Education becomes self-reinforcing  
      
    
- Certificates become verifiable digital assets  
      
    
- Learning is no longer a cost burden but a productive pathway
