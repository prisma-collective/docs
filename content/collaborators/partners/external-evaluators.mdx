> This call was recorded on Thursday, 4th December, 2025. The gentleman in the call is Abdulrahman from [NexTrend](https://docs-two-ashen.vercel.app/) Hub in Lagos, Nigeria. The reason why this is part of our invitation is that it drops you right into the middle of the process, live, with real questions from one of the hubs trying to understand the role that the external evaluators play. In this call, we discuss continuous evaluation as distinct from a kind of "submission" and "scorecard" approach. The evaluation app in discussion is one means hubs are being provided to make available a perspective to evaluators for them to inquire into the work happening on the ground. 

external evaluators are distinct from practitioners of [evaluation](/processes/evaluation). whereas evaluation is a domain of [process design](/glossary/Process%20Design%20Collective), external evaluators are invited at key stages in an [action-learning journey](/patterns/action-learning%20journeys), as partners, in both a receiving and restraining capacity.

Seeing the value in a complex process requires multiple perspectives. 

The external perspective of external evaluators is more removed from the process than those [participating](/patterns/action-learning), and that detachment offers a vantage point from which to see things more objectively. For many teams, the objective is to actualise [potential](/glossary/place-sourced%20potential) and they are likely seeking partners to walk with them in that journey.

Therefore, the invitation to external evaluators is to [decide](/processes/enactment), whether for themselves or on behalf of someone else, if they would like to enter into such a partnership, why, and on what terms. 

To register as an external evaluator, please use the form below.
