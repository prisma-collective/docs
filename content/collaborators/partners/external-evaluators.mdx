sidebarTitle: External Evaluators
---

import StandardButton from '@/components/StandardButton';

external evaluators are distinct from practitioners of [evaluation](/processes/evaluation). whereas evaluation is a domain of [process design](/glossary/Process%20Design%20Collective), external evaluators are invited at key stages in an [action-learning journey](/patterns/action-learning%20journeys), as partners, in both a receiving and restraining capacity.

Seeing the value in a complex process requires multiple perspectives. 

The external perspective of external evaluators is more removed from the process than those [participating](/patterns/action-learning), and that detachment offers a vantage point from which to see things more objectively. For many teams, the objective is to actualise [potential](/glossary/place-sourced%20potential) and they are likely seeking partners to walk with them in that journey.

Therefore, the invitation to external evaluators is to [decide](/processes/enactment), whether for themselves or on behalf of someone else, if they would like to enter into such a partnership, why, and on what terms.
