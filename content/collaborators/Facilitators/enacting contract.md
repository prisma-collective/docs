# Purpose of the Role
The purpose of Enacting is to develop the processes by which participants of an [action-learning journey](/patterns/action-learning%20journeys.md) (ALJ) are able to embody and act-out a systemic intervention in place, balancing the delivery of functional requirements with whole-system actualisation. 

# Domains of Practice
#### Design

- The overall movement that the ALJ facilitation is holding - i.e. the action of a given ALJ as a whole.
- Key evaluation touchpoints that generate the data necessary to make visible key differences in approach:
	- Living systems vs. mechanistic
	- Pedagogical vs. depositing [^1]
	- Place-sourced vs. pre-defined
	- Complexity-aware vs. reductionist
	- etc...
- The developmental and pedagogical aspects of the action - how the process will be rich with learnings in a way that is meaningful to the place in which the ALJ is hosted. 
- Learning resources that participants can draw upon to engage with the facilitation.

#### Facilitation

- Awareness and sensitivity of how the action design will meet the ongoing hub activity and potential of place.
- Designing key calls, workshops and activities to materialise the action process designed.
- Offering insights and interventions to nudge and unblock energies during the intensive.

#### Organisation

- Introduction of key practices internally to the facilitator group to ensure key learning capabilities are being developed
- Clarification of roles needed to take aligned action toward the organisation's purpose
- Restraint on the approach to infrastructure development in order to maintain living systems integrity

# Responsibilities and Accountabilities
Concrete responsibilities currently held by the role-holder.

- Creating the conditions for emergence, generating a self-organising impulse within the timeframe of an ALJ, and stewarding the alignment with the ALJs overall outcome aims. 
	- Field
	- Embodiment
	- Relationality
- Sensing into how to engage and co-evolve with partners.
- Arrival of Prisma into place. 
- Application of systems evolution practice to the systems of place in which the ALJ is hosted. 
- Organisational discovery and actualisation.
- Case-study publication.

Key accountabilities are listed below. These are living agreements and should be reviewed regularly.

- Documenting designs for each ALJ as resources of learning for both participants and prisma internal team members.
- Facilitating and moderating activities online and in-person.
	- Onboarding calls
	- Workshops
	- Programmes
- Ensuring internal evolvability and ongoing learning.
- Evolving approach to action design and facilitation between ALJs.
- Drawing attention to key enabling capacities in all organisational contexts - internal, partners, incubated action-learning teams. 
- Communicating the limitations and possibilities of technology in an alive and emotional world. 
- Drawing from the development and application of ALJs (and/ or other relevant experience, such as other applications of social technology) to co-design with... 
	- Developers within action-learning teams as they build their place-unique integrations, as well as
	- Developers internal to prisma as they build ALJ participation tooling and distributed ALJ whole-system infrastructure. 
- Publishing a case-study per ALJ.
	- Communicating the application of practice
	- Communicating learnings generated: what was unexpected, novel, stagnant, challenging, easy...
	- Communicating the limitations of the practice in reality vs. the theory and ideal
	- Communicating how the practice itself evolved through the course of the ALJ

# Learning and Evolution
This section outlines how the role will be supported to evolve over time.

#### Learning Practices

- Each important call, such as will external stakeholders, will be followed by a debrief/ action-review
- Monthly leadership check-ins aim to create the space for reflections on governance, power, freedom of expression etc.
- Ongoing development is supported by the multi-disciplinary nature of our organisation

#### Known Edges and Learning Questions

This role, focussing more on embodiment and learning design, may be less familiar with the specialised knowledge-area of web3, software development and non-social information systems at large. It is exactly because of this that Enacting is absolutely vital in applying restraint on the technological proposals made. It is a stewarding role within Enacting to remember the collective into a ecologically informed foundation for all its work.

The overarching question held by this role is "What is needed for the technology developed during an ALJ to be coming from a direction that truly honours the miracle of life?"

That includes...

- Developer experience, learning and integrity
- Approaches to sense-making (observation, relation, being)
- Future-visioning, communication, and co-learning between different roles

#### Review Process
The role will be reviewed after every ALJ.

# Tension and Feedback Protocols
#### How Tensions Are Surfaced

- 1:1 as and when needed, ideally surfacing tensions as soon as possible
- In one of the dedicated scheduled calls
- Via the support of another, when needed

#### Frequency of Feedback
Per ALJ.

# Governance and Decision-Making
#### Consent and Role Change

- It is the individual's responsibility to ensure all major decisions are brought to at least the most relevant organisational context in a professional and timely manner. This could mean the individual's team, a suitable sub-group, or the organisation as a whole. 
- The individual is free to choose, change, and adapt the role they contribute by as and when suits them, given necessary considerations such as social implications, timeliness, and communication needs. 

#### Relation to Wider Governance Structures

- The individual is responsible for communicating the strengths and limitations of the role as part of the larger organisational context, seeking out necessary confidants to start the conversation with. If at any point, it does not feel safe to do so, please refer to a dedicated trust node.
- Any changes to governance structures and processes that could help either the role or the organisation as a whole to evolve are encouraged and it is down to the individual to generate (and regenerate) that awareness. 
- As a core role, Enacting is expected to actively shape the organisation as a whole, bringing their experience and learnings forward to inform how the role and organisation can evolve - as much as possible. 

# Energy Exchange
#### Compensation or Stipend
Per ALJ.
#### Other Forms of Exchange
As a core role, Enacting is entrusted with equity share, decided on a case-by-case basis between the core team. 
#### Reimbursement
Travel to and from ALJ intensives will be covered where possible.
