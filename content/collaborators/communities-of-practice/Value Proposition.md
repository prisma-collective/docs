# Perceiving the Problem: Cardano Needs Real-world Use-cases
Cardano's framing as the blockchain for enterprise makes the case that the time has come to move beyond technical intricacies to broad-scale adoption, oftentimes with the underlying technology itself stepping more into the background to make space for more familiar and accessible value-proposition narratives. This applies to a variety of sectors, as is evidenced by the variety of panel talks at the last summits. Cardano is proving out its utility across a diversity of use-cases. 

There is a huge potential for Cardano to grow roots in many industries, however, many entrepreneurial initiatives still come from within the web3 ecosystem. The approaches to break into traditional markets, create entirely new ones, or bring on-board legacy systems often comes from a perspective of seeing Cardano as something separate, and this reinforces the challenge of retention: people start because they want to build on Cardano, but once that initial excitement fades, so too does their participation in the ecosystem.

In this proposal, we put forwards a case for a shift in perspective: from one that starts with the technology at the centre, to one that puts life at the centre, as part of a much longer-term ecosystem partnership. We'll frame our work with Wada as the trialling of a full-stack incubator and what that means, and then we'll highlight the upcoming opportunity to build forwards into a much larger network, for which this proposal is being written. First, we need to properly set the context and provide our rationale for why we're approaching it in this way.
