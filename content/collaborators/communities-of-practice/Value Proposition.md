Cardano's framing as the blockchain for enterprise makes the case that the time has come to move beyond technical intricacies to broad-scale adoption, oftentimes with the underlying technology itself stepping more into the background to make space for more familiar and accessible value-proposition narratives. This applies to a variety of sectors, as is evidenced by the variety of panel talks at the last summits. Cardano is proving out its utility across a diversity of use-cases. 

However, many growth initiatives still come from within the ecosystem, trying to break into traditional markets, create entirely new ones, or migrate legacy systems. All of these approaches come from a perspective of seeing Cardano as something separate, and this reinforces the challenge of retention: people come because they want to build on Cardano, and if that changes, so too does their ecosystem engagement. In this proposal, we put forwards the case for starting from the perspective of purpose, shifting the focus to long-term partnerships and further de-emphasising the underlying technology itself. In this way, Cardano becomes an integral enabling capability within a larger, mutualistic organisational development effort.
