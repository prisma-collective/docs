Cardano's framing as the blockchain for enterprise makes the case that the time has come to move beyond technical intricacies to broad-scale adoption, oftentimes with the underlying technology itself stepping more into the background to make space for more familiar value-proposition narratives. 

This applies to a variety of sectors, as is evidenced by the variety of panel talks at the last summits. Cardano is proving out its utility across a diversity of use-cases. However, many growth initiatives still come from within the ecosystem, trying to break into traditional markets, create entirely new ones, or migrate legacy systems. All of these approaches come from a perspective of seeing Cardano as something separate. In this proposal, we put forwards the case for starting from purpose, from which Cardano is one key enabling capability within a larger mutually beneficial partnership effort.
