# Perceiving the Problem: Cardano Needs Real-world Use-cases
Cardano's framing as the blockchain for enterprise makes the case that the time has come to move beyond technical intricacies to broad-scale adoption, oftentimes with the underlying technology itself stepping more into the background to make space for more familiar and accessible value-proposition narratives. This applies to a variety of sectors, as is evidenced by the variety of panel talks at the last summits. Cardano is proving out its utility across a diversity of use-cases. 

There is a huge potential for Cardano to grow roots in many industries, however, many entrepreneurial initiatives still come from within the web3 ecosystem. The approaches to break into traditional markets, create entirely new ones, or bring on-board legacy systems often comes from a perspective of seeing Cardano as something separate, and this reinforces the challenge of retention: people start because they want to build on Cardano, but once that initial excitement fades, so too does their participation in the ecosystem.

In this proposal, we put forwards a case for a shift in perspective: from one that starts with the technology at the centre, to one that puts life at the centre, as part of a much longer-term ecosystem partnership with impact networks. We'll frame our work with Wada as the trialling of a full-stack incubator and what that means, and then we'll highlight the upcoming opportunity to build forwards into a second and much larger network, for which this proposal is being written. First, we need to properly set the context and provide our rationale for why we're approaching the work in this way.
# Impact Networks, Systems and Practice Currencies
Prisma as a project emerged toward the end of the Regenerative Finance spring, in 2022. Although many projects were still able to attract funding, largely building on the false success of the Voluntary Carbon Market, signs were already starting to appear that indicated the limitations of token-centric approaches to governance and capital distribution. Mechanism design offered a fleeting glimmer of hope that encouraged numerous efforts to determine how to incentivise a collective effort "fix" things, in service of honourable causes. However, the current era of DAO patterning has largely failed to resemble true collective intelligence, no matter how often it is promised, and the vast majority of impact funding stayed and remains off-chain. Of the many possible reasons for this, we'll highlight the three Prisma is actively addressing:
