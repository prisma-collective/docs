	2025 will see the delivery of the [Accra action-learning journey](https://projectcatalyst.io/funds/13/f13-cardano-open-ecosystem/wada-hub-hackathon-a-local-community-catalyst), the start of the [Regenesis](/collaborators/communities-of-practice/Regenesis.md) Story of Place programme, and potentially a few other exciting collaborations. 

	The image above shows the same underlying pattern of event organising, which applies four [core processes](/patterns/core%20processes.md), across three different contexts:

		A. Accra: Wada Hub in Accra, Ghana, for the Cardano Catalyst Fund 13 application
		B. Regenesis and aligned partners such as Resilience
		C. Regenerative Investing: atreyu & ria

	In all the [action-learning journeys](/patterns/action-learning%20journeys.md) (ALJs), we are aiming to form one or multiple action-learning teams that work on-the-ground on the development and application of an instrument (tooling). 

	Each ALJ also generates content: videos, interviews, call recordings, wikis, art works. This content is curated by the [hubs](/collaborators/communities-of-place/hub/hubs.md) to publish [case-studies](/patterns/case-study) of the process. 

	These case studies are developmental learning accounts: each with levels of depth. Our [business model](business model) centres around the subscription to these journeys to access the depth. Each event is a catalyst for the ongoing [storying](storying) of the work, ongoing [action-learning](/patterns/action-learning.md), evolving thinking, making the subscription model appropriate. [Communities of place](Communities of place) own these learning accounts and are the primary recipients of subscription fees. 

	Over time, using these ALJs as the innovation engine, we will build out action-learning [infrastructure](infrastructure): distributed means of participating in action-learning journeys. This is to work towards a platform where these events organise themselves and people work in a distributed manner on bioregional transition pathways. All capacities and resourcing is organised and accounted for in a decentralised manner by leveraging these underlying patterns we're working on.

	# Roadmap
	In summary, although each level is, to some extent, active simultaneously, we are focussing on the orders of system actualisation sequentially:

	1. Case studies: 2025+
	2. Incubation: 2026-2028+
	3. Self-organising ALJ Ecosystem: 2028-2030+

	## Case-studies as Developmental Accounts

	In order to on-board [hubs](/collaborators/communities-of-place/hub/hubs.md) into self-organising and self-[publishing](/processes/process-infrastructuring/publishing.md) capacity, prisma is first manually organising and facilitating several [action-learning journeys](/patterns/action-learning%20journeys.md) (ALJs) to build internal capability for effective distributed system design. 

	This is also the period in which to generate clarity and cohesion of the core underlying patterns that are most relevant (see image) in publishing developmental accounts of [action-learning](/patterns/action-learning.md):

	1. Mapping - making visible the network hub and the future ALJs being potentialised
	2. [Publishing](/processes/process-infrastructuring/publishing.md) - making the learnings generated during the action-learning journey available to a broader audience
	3. [action-learning journeys](/patterns/action-learning%20journeys.md)
	4. On-the-ground practitioners (aka fellows) - those who are stewarding the alignment between ALJ organising and [place-sourced potential](/glossary/place-sourced%20potential.md)
	5. [Practice-in-place](/processes/enactment/) and [Place-in-practice](/processes/evaluation/) - the challenge of working with such large systems as an evolving [community of practice](community of practice) and [communities of place](communities of place), and how they interrelate to co-evolve together, through hotspots of activity where transformation can occur. [^1]
	6. Networking - accounting for the [practice-contributions](/processes/process-infrastructuring/practice-currencies.md) that bring [places](/glossary/Place) to life (measurements of participation, system effects, and DAOs)

	Therefore, by the end of this year, we are aiming to have generated the internal clarity of these patterns needed to be able to deliver on the promise of one published [case-study](/patterns/case-study.md) per ALJ event. That means:

	1. [Evaluation](/processes/evaluation) - how we make visible value
		1. Timeline interface making visible multiple layers of activity in an interactive front-end that becomes part of the [case-study](/patterns/case-study.md) (in-progress)
		2. Thorough evaluation framework, aided by being able to explore the timeline, and in-formable by a given ALJ's action design
	2. [Enaction](/processes/enactment) - how we activate self-organising
		1. Enaction design framework/ methodology
		2. [Practice](/glossary/Practice.md) participation mechanisms
		3. Enaction-Evaluation interrelationship ([action-learning](/patterns/action-learning.md))
	3. [Potentialising](/processes/ground-potentialising) - how we develop the potential of an [action-learning journey](action-learning journey)
		1. Mapping hub network and ALJ instances - the interface for where each [case-study](/patterns/case-study.md) is published
	4. [Enrolment](/processes/enrolment.md) - how we sign-up and on-board participants
		1. ALJ-specific stakeholder development pathways
			1. Sign-up forms
			2. On-boarding calls that facilitate alignment with enaction design

	Scales-appropriate capabilities: 

	- Incubation outcome: product innovation
	- Practice outcome: practice currency
	- Organising team: prisma core
	- Lead impulse: individual practitioner on-the-ground
	- Prisma as distributed system: 
		- Evaluation interface complete
		- Potentialising interface complete
	## Incubation

	Scales-appropriate capabilities: 

	- Incubation outcome: organisation
	- Practice outcome: practice DAO
	- Organising team: hub team
	- Lead impulse: hub and/ or practitioner-group
	- Prisma as distributed system: all core processes with active DAO groups evolving them, rudimentary prisma on-chain governance and community currency systems
		- Participant profiles
		- Participation reputation
		- Team-formation
		- System-wide practice-currency visibility (seeing activity on-the-ground)

	## Self-organising ALJ Ecosystem

	Scales-appropriate capabilities: 

	- Incubation outcome: ecosystemic partnerships shift
