## Project Overview

### Problem Statement

In Abuja, waste collection activity happens daily but leaves no verifiable record, creating a trust vacuum across the entire value chain. When Ibrahim collects 15 kilograms of PET bottles and the buyer claims it was only 12, he has no receipt, timestamp, or proof to dispute the transaction. 

This pattern repeats everywhere: residents pay waste companies but cannot prove trucks failed to show up, government disburses contractor budgets without verifying tonnage claims, and corporate CSR programs cannot demonstrate measurable impact to shareholders. 

The breakdown is not that people refuse to do the work—but that completed work leaves no immutable record linking action to outcome, making it impossible to value contributions correctly. Cardano blockchain with Aiken smart contracts provides the missing verification layer by recording GPS coordinates, photo hashes, timestamps, and wallet addresses immutably on-chain, making invisible labor visible to systems that previously could not see it.

### Solution Summary

SendWaste Cardano is a blockchain-powered waste recovery verification platform that creates tamper-proof proof of work for every waste collection event.

Each verified recovery includes:

- Photo + GPS verification
- NFT receipt minted on Cardano
- Timestamped, geofenced recovery record
- Automated WASTE token rewards
- Real-time ESG and material flow tracking

This transforms waste from an unverified activity into a bankable, traceable, and rewarding economic system.

## Target Community

**Primary Users:**

- Informal waste collectors in Abuja (Kubwa, Gwarimpa, Dutse, Lugbe)
- Low-income households needing verified service delivery
- Recycling businesses suffering from unstable material supply
- ESG-driven companies and public institutions needing real impact data

**Why This Matters in the Nigerian Context:**

- Blocked drains → flooding → disease outbreaks
- Youth unemployment → waste recovery becomes verified income
- No credit history → collectors remain financially excluded
- ESG budgets rising → but unverifiable data destroys trust

SendWaste restores trust by making every recovery event provable, every collector bank-visible, and every ton of waste digitally accountable.

## Evidence of Grounded Work

### Web2 Foundation (Launched 2023)

**Live Platform:** [sendwaste.com](https://sendwaste.com)

SendWaste began as a web2 marketplace connecting waste generators to collectors in Abuja. The platform has been operational for two years, providing baseline data that informed the Cardano blockchain migration strategy.

### AURA E-Store - Upcycling Proof of Concept

**Live Store:** [sendwaste.com/aura](https://sendwaste.com/aura)

Demonstrates material recovery outcomes by showcasing upcycled products created from verified waste streams, validating that waste recovery creates economic opportunity beyond collection fees.

## Technical Implementation

### Why Cardano?

**Fee Economics:**
- Cardano: ~₦100 (0.15 ADA) per transaction
- Ethereum: ₦3,000-30,000 per transaction
- When users earn ₦500-2,000 per submission, Ethereum fees kill the model

**Energy Alignment:**
- Proof-of-stake: ~0.01 TWh annually
- Cannot solve environmental problem using technology that burns planet

**Formal Verification:**
- Aiken smart contracts provide mathematical proof of correctness
- Prevents hidden bugs that drain user funds
