## What I Saw Walking Abuja

I spent six weeks walking Kubwa Market, Gwarimpa estates, Dutse settlements, and Lugbe communities. What stood out was not the piles of waste itself. Everyone knows waste exists. What struck me was the **invisible economy operating around it**.

In Kubwa, pre-dawn collectors arrive at 5am to sort through bins before the official trucks come. They know which households separate recyclables. They have routes memorized. They work fast because competition is real. By 7am they are gone. By 9am official collectors arrive to haul mixed waste to dumps. Two parallel systems operating with zero coordination.

At Gwarimpa Estate, residents pay private waste companies monthly fees. The trucks show up irregularly. Residents complain but keep paying because the alternative is living with overflowing bins. When I asked why they do not separate recyclables, one woman said *"what for? The truck just mixes everything anyway."* Fair point.

Dutse settlement has no formal waste collection. People burn plastic at night when smoke blends into darkness. Kids play near dumpsites because space is limited and nobody marks hazard zones. Every rainy season the same streets flood because drains clog with bottles and nylon. Every dry season residents cough from smoke. The cycle repeats.

## Voices From the Ground

### Ibrahim, Kubwa Collector (15 years experience)

*"I know this work. I can tell you which houses put out cardboard on Tuesdays and which ones separate cans on Fridays. My problem is not finding waste. My problem is proving to buyers what I collected. They weigh it and give me whatever price they want. I cannot argue because I have no receipt, no proof, nothing. How do I save money when my income changes by 30 percent week to week based on someone else's mood?"*

Ibrahim is not looking for charity. He wants documentation. He wants his work to count towards something that banks recognize. Right now his labour exists in a shadow economy. Fifteen years of consistent work and he still cannot get a loan to buy a proper cart or storage space.

### Mrs. Adebayo, Gwarimpa Resident

*"Last month the waste company did not come for three weeks. My children got sick from the smell. I called their number. No answer. I paid a private collector ₦2,000 to clear it. He took the bags. I have no idea where they went. For all I know he dumped them in the nearest drain. What can I do? Report to who? Based on what evidence?"*

She pays for a service that operates on broken promises. The lack of accountability runs both ways. She cannot prove the company failed to collect. The company cannot prove they came if she disputes the invoice. Everyone operates on trust that repeatedly breaks.

### Chioma, 22, Economics Graduate

*"Jobs are not there. I send applications every week. Nothing comes back. But people here work. Look around. Everyone is hustling something. If there was a way to earn from cleaning this place, people would do it. We just need to know we will actually get paid. Not promised. Actually paid. Show me someone who submitted waste today and withdrew cash today. Then I will believe it."*

She is not naive. She has watched too many programs announce opportunities that evaporate. Her skepticism is earned. She wants proof before participation. That demand shapes how any solution has to work.

### Anonymous AEPB Official

*"We budget ₦50 million annually for waste management in this zone alone. Where does it go? Contractors submit reports showing tonnage collected. We have no way to verify those numbers. They could write anything. They know we cannot check every dumpsite or track every truck. So we pay based on estimates instead of facts. If someone built a system where we could see real-time what was collected, where, and by who, we would use it immediately. Right now we are managing blindly."*

Government is not the villain here. They face asymmetric information. Contractors have incentive to inflate numbers. Officials have no tools to verify claims. Budget gets spent without measurable outcomes.

## Observations (what keeps repeating)

- Informal collectors operate with precision but remain invisible to formal institutions
- Residents pay for waste services but cannot verify delivery
- Government allocates budgets without ability to verify contractor claims
- Health costs accumulate from waste exposure but are never attributed back to collection failures
- Two parallel systems (informal and formal) operate with zero coordination
- Trust has collapsed because proof infrastructure disappeared
- Environmental harm compounds because nobody sees waste flows in real-time

## Patterns, Tensions, and Themes

### Pattern 1: Informal Systems Work, Formal Systems Do Not

Informal collectors operate daily with precision. They know routes, timing, material types. Their efficiency is high. Their earnings are unstable because they lack documentation.

Formal waste companies have contracts and trucks. They collect irregularly. Service quality varies. Residents pay but cannot verify delivery.

**The pattern is not that informal systems need to become formal. The pattern is that valuable work happens outside visibility.**

### Pattern 2: Trust Collapsed Because Proof Disappeared

Every stakeholder mentioned trust breakdown. Residents do not trust collectors. Collectors do not trust buyers. Government does not trust contractors. Contractors do not trust payment timelines.

This was not always the case. Older residents remember when waste collection was reliable. What changed was not people caring less. What changed was accountability infrastructure degrading.

**Without proof of work, without receipts, without timestamps, every transaction becomes a negotiation where the person with more power wins.**

### Pattern 3: Environmental Harm Compounds Because Nobody Sees Flows

Flooding in Lugbe happens because PET bottles clog drains. Everyone knows this. Nobody knows how many bottles enter drains weekly or which neighborhoods produce the most.

NESREA studies show plastic contributes 17% to drain blockages. That number is based on surveys, not real-time tracking.

**If you cannot measure flows, you cannot redirect them.**

## A Typical Waste Collection Cycle

**Daily Timeline:**
- 5:00am - Informal collectors begin routes
- 6:30am - Peak collection period for recyclables
- 8:00am - Materials sold to aggregators
- 9:00am - Formal waste trucks start rounds (when they come)
- 12:00pm - Markets generate organic waste peaks
- 3:00pm - Afternoon heat makes uncollected waste unbearable
- 6:00pm - Residents place bins out for next day collection
- 8:00pm - Informal dumping increases in unlit areas
- 11:00pm - Night burning begins in settlements without collection

**Weekly Cycle:**  
Monday residents expect collection → By Thursday frustration builds → By Sunday people pay informal collectors or dump illegally → Repeat

**Seasonal Cycle:**  
Rainy season (April-October): Flooding intensifies, drains clog, disease spreads, political pressure rises, budgets allocated, contractors paid, flooding continues next year.

Dry season (November-March): Burning increases, air quality drops, respiratory complaints rise, materials sit longer.

## What Abuja Needs (In Their Words, Not Mine)

After 23 conversations, the ask is consistent: **make work count**.

- Ibrahim does not want a subsidy. He wants his 15 years of collections to translate into credit history that a bank accepts.
- Chioma does not want promises. She wants to see someone earn and withdraw today to know the system is real.
- Mrs. Adebayo does not want cheaper service. She wants proof that the service she pays for actually happens.
- Government does not want more reports. They want data they can verify independently.
- Recyclers do not want market studies. They want to see live material availability so they can plan logistics.

**Nobody asked me to build an app. They asked for systems that do not lie.**

Blockchain does not lie. Timestamps are immutable. GPS coordinates are verifiable. Photo hashes cannot be faked twice. Transactions execute based on code, not discretion.

**Core Insight:**

SendWaste is not inserting blockchain into waste management because it sounds innovative. SendWaste puts waste recovery on-chain because that is the only infrastructure that makes invisible work visible in a way institutions accept.

**Once work is visible, everything else becomes possible. Credit. Coordination. Planning. Accountability.**

Abuja already has people doing the work. What Abuja lacks is proof infrastructure. Build the proof layer and the economic layer builds itself.
