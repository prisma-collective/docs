# 🗺️ Stakeholder Map — StemTrust

**Concept:** Mapping the ecosystem of Research Funding in Abuja.

---

## The Map Layers

### 1. Caretakers (The Support System)
*People who hold the system together despite the challenges.*

- **Department Heads (HODs):** Often use personal networks to secure small opportunities for students.
- **Peer Review Groups:** Informal WhatsApp groups where researchers share calls for proposals.
- **Lab Technicians:** Managing scarce resources to keep experiments running.

---

### 2. Stakeholders (The Institutions)
*The powerful players who control resources.*

- **TETFund (Tertiary Education Trust Fund):** The primary government funding body (HQ in Abuja).
- **National Universities Commission (NUC):** Regulatory body setting standards.
- **University Administrations:** The gatekeepers of institutional grants.
- **Foreign Embassies/Donors:** USAID, DFID, etc., offering competitive but limited grants.

---

### 3. Emerging Leaders (The Disrupters)
*New actors trying to change the narrative.*

- **StemTrust Team:** Introducing blockchain transparency.
- **Tech Hubs (e.g., Ventures Park):** Beginning to look at "Deep Tech" beyond just software.
- **Student Research Associations:** Demanding more transparency in how fees/funds are used.
- **Diaspora Nigerian Scientists:** Looking for trustworthy ways to give back.
- **Cardano Community (Abuja Chapter):** Promoting decentralized governance tools.

---

### 4. Affected Groups (The Victims)

- **Early-Career Researchers:** Most vulnerable to "The Waiting Game."
- **Post-Graduate Students:** Often delayed for years due to funding-related pauses.
- **The Nigerian Public:** Denied local solutions to local problems (e.g., local agricultural, health innovations).

## Flow of Influence

**The Current System:**

- Government/TETFund → Funds → University Admin → Opaque Allocation → Researcher
- Foreign Donors → Strict Conditions → Researcher
- Diaspora/Private Sector → Trust Gap → (blocked) → Researcher

**The Outcomes:**

- Researcher → Exit/Japa → Brain Drain
- Researcher → Success (Rare) → Local Innovation

**The Opportunity:**

- StemTrust Platform → Transparency → Diaspora
- StemTrust Platform → Direct Funding → Researcher
