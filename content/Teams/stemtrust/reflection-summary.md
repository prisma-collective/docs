# 💭 Team Reflection Summary — StemTrust

**Location:** Abuja, Nigeria

---

## What shifted in our perspective?

Initially, we approached this project as a **FinTech solution**—building a wallet for researchers. However, walking through the university departments and speaking to lecturers in Gwagwalada shifted our perspective deeply. We realized that **money is not the only issue; dignity is.** 

Researchers feel humiliated by the begging they often have to do for basic supplies. We moved from thinking about "transactions" to thinking about "reputation" and "visibility." The blockchain is not just a ledger for cash; it must be a ledger for *provenance* and *success*.

## What surprised or moved us?

We were startled by the **"files on the floor"** phenomenon. Seeing physical stacks of grant applications gathering dust in administrative offices was a visceral representation of lost potential. 

Conversely, we were moved by the resilience of a biochemistry student who was using her personal savings from a side-hustle to fund a malaria feasibility study. The passion is there; the system is just failing to metabolize it.

## What is the community asking for?

They are not asking for charity. They are asking for a **fair chance**.

1. **Speed:** They want to know "Yes" or "No" quickly, not wait in limbo.
2. **Directness:** They want to bypass the layers of administration that skim off value.
3. **Validation:** They want their work to be seen by the world, not just buried in a local archive.

Our understanding has evolved: **StemTrust must be a dignity engine, not just a crowdfunding site.**
