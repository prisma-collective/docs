## Project Overview

### Problem Statement

The global e-learning market is massive, yet it is structurally broken at its financial core.

Independent educators—the backbone of the creator economy—are forced into a damaging trade-off:

- Legacy platforms provide trust, but lock creator earnings behind 30–60 day payment delays, crushing cash flow and treating teachers as low-priority vendors.
- Informal channels provide fast cash, but offer zero trust, zero quality assurance, and zero scalability for students.
In our community, most online learning happens informally on WhatsApp, creating widespread issues of trust, low-quality instruction, and financial risk for both learners and tutors. This matters because thousands of people lose money, receive unverifiable certificates, or fail to gain real skills despite paying for courses. The core challenge emerging from our exploration is the lack of reliable infrastructure to support payments, reputation, and verifiable learning outcomes. We see an opportunity to introduce a trust layer that ensures accountability, protects funds, and validates competence. 
Technology, particularly blockchain-backed escrow, verification, and credentialing, can play a meaningful role in transforming this informal system into a secure and trustworthy learning environment.

This creates a fundamental contradiction:

The teacher needs instant, predictable income.  
The student needs a money-back safety net.

Because this trust gap is never properly resolved, it suppresses transactions, increases disputes, reduces quality, and ultimately starves both sides of the market of fair value.

### Solution Summary

Classly is a decentralized FinTech infrastructure layer for the education creator economy, built on the Cardano blockchain.

It is not a traditional EdTech platform.  
It is the financial rail that fixes broken trust between students and teachers.

At the center of Classly is its proprietary smart-contract-backed escrow system:

### Core Innovation: The 30 / 40 / 30 Accelerated Release Model

This model restructures how teachers get paid and how students are protected:

**Phase 1 – Instant Liquidity (30%)**  
Triggered immediately upon student enrollment. This removes the long waiting period imposed by legacy platforms and gives teachers instant working capital.

**Phase 2 – Quality Assurance (40%)**  
Triggered when an objective engagement milestone is reached (for example, 50% video completion). This ties payment directly to content consumption—not subjective reviews—creating measurable accountability.

**Phase 3 – Final Trust (30%)**  
Triggered after the refund window expires (for example, 14 days). This protects the student, finalizes the transaction, and creates predictable settlement for the platform.

This system replaces platform-controlled payouts with automated, rules-based financial fairness.

## The Moat: Verifiable Trust & Reputation

Classly does not only fix payments—it builds permanent, verifiable trust infrastructure:

**NFT Certificates**  
Issued upon course completion as tamper-proof, blockchain-minted credentials. This transforms course completion into a portable, verifiable career asset.

**On-Chain Ratings**  
Ratings are immutably recorded on-chain using Merkle Trees, eliminating manipulation, fake reviews, and reputation attacks.

**Video Core Infrastructure**  
Integrated video upload, hosting, and structured playback allow teachers to define objective engagement milestones that power the 40% release trigger.

Together, these systems replace platform-controlled trust with mathematical, cryptographic trust.

## Strategic Market Logic

Classly positions itself as:

**"The Stripe for the Education Creator Economy."**

Instead of competing with every EdTech marketplace, Classly becomes the financial backbone that:

- Powers fair payments
- Enforces verifiable credentials
- Standardizes trust across creator education

This allows Classly to scale across multiple platforms, communities, and creator ecosystems, not just a single marketplace.

**Teachers want:**
- Faster earnings
- Predictable income
- Respect as independent economic actors

**Students want:**
- Trust
- Refund protection
- Verifiable credentials

Classly delivers all three through smart-contract-enforced financial logic.

We are not asking for a seat at the table.  
We are rebuilding the table itself.
