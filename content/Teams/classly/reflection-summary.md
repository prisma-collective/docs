# 💭 Team Reflection Summary — Classly

Before speaking with people in our community, we assumed the main challenge in online learning was improving course delivery and helping creators organize their content more efficiently. But after listening to learners, tutors, and community managers, our perspective shifted completely: the core problem is not content, it is **trust**. People are not struggling to learn; they are struggling to feel safe, recognized, and protected in an ecosystem built on screenshots, scattered receipts, and unverified claims.

What surprised us most was how normalized this dysfunction has become. Learners described losing money, receiving fake or meaningless certificates, and lacking any assurance about who they were paying. Tutors expressed frustration around reputation, credibility, and the administrative chaos that keeps them from teaching professionally. These stories moved us because they revealed a much deeper systemic failure than we expected—an entire informal education economy being held together by hope rather than infrastructure.

From these conversations, the community's ask became unmistakably clear: **they want a system they can trust**. They want secure payments, transparent reputation, structured learning, and credentials that actually mean something. They want protection against fraud, a way to verify skill, and a path to earn or learn without fear.

This reflection reshaped our direction as a team. We are no longer thinking about "making e-learning better," but about building the **trust architecture** that online learning in our place desperately needs.

**Classly is the FinTech solution to an EdTech problem.**
