## Project Overview

### Problem Statement

Many students in Nigeria and Africa face high exam failure rates and cannot access affordable study tools. Most online prep platforms are paid and offer no real incentives to keep learners motivated. Many students are also excluded because they lack smartphones or stable internet. We also realized that certificates from most platforms are not verifiable, limiting trust and opportunities.

Across many Nigerian communities, students struggle with three connected barriers:

1. **Low motivation to study consistently**
2. **High cost of exam registration and preparation**
3. **Limited access to reliable digital learning tools, especially offline**

Even when students are willing to learn, the system offers:

- No direct incentive for daily study habits
- No easy verification of learning outcomes
- No simple way to convert academic effort into financial support for exam access

Learning becomes effort without reward and many students fall out of the system not because they lack ability, but because the system does not sustain them.

### Solution Summary

**READS transforms education into a Learn-to-Earn experience.**

Students are rewarded with blockchain tokens for:

- Studying learning materials
- Completing quizzes
- Passing Computer-Based Test (CBT) simulations

READS also provides:

- Full CBT practice environment
- Verifiable on-chain academic certificates
- Integrated exam-fee payment support
- Digital learning marketplace
- USSD access for offline and low-connectivity users

This creates a closed educational economy where effort, achievement, certification, and access to exams are structurally connected.

## Core System Structure

READS operates across four tightly linked layers:

### 1. Learn Layer
Students study digital content and prepare using CBT-style practice questions.

### 2. Test Layer
Quizzes and CBT simulations measure real understanding, not guesswork.

### 3. Earn Layer
Smart contracts reward verified performance with blockchain tokens.

### 4. Access Layer
Tokens can be used for:

- Paying exam registration fees
- Accessing educational tools
- Participating in the digital marketplace

**For users without smartphones or internet:**

USSD access ensures inclusion, removing connectivity as a barrier to education.
