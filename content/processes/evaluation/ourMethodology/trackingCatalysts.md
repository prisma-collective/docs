# **Phase 2: Tracking Catalysts**

## **Goal: To make emergent dynamics and the flow of value visible in near real-time, identifying the catalysts of change as they happen.**

This is the dynamic heart of our methodology. During an active engagement like an ALJ, we use multiple instruments to capture the "pulse" of the system. We track not just static data points, but the relationships, exchanges, and transformative moments that drive systemic evolution.

## **Our Instruments for Tracking Value Flow**

1. **Diverse Data Capture**  
    We gather data from multiple sources to create a rich, multi-dimensional picture of reality.
    
    - **Qualitative & Narrative Data:** We use accessible tools like **Telegram bots** for participants to submit real-time **voice notes** and text reflections. This captures the nuanced, often-invisible "warm data" of lived experience.
        
    - **Structured Data:** We use simple **forms, ratings, and point systems** to gather quantitative data on specific indicators.
        
    - **Programmatic & Observational Data:** We also integrate programmatic data (e.g., code submissions, public chat histories) and structured observations from facilitators.
        
2. **Relational Indexing**  
    Our technology does more than just store data; it creates a **relational map**. Every piece of data is automatically indexed by:
    
    - **Who** contributed it.
        
    - **When** and in what context.
        
    - **What** Aspects and Capitals it relates to.
        
    - **How** it connects to other people, activities, and data points.  
    This allows us to see the web of influence, not just a list of events.
    
3. **Multi-Source Verification**  
    To ensure reliability, insights are continuously cross-referenced. We use a "four-way verification" process that triangulates data from:
    
    - **Facilitator** observations and field notes.
        
    - **Peer** attributions and feedback ("I received value from...").
        
    - **Expert** review where applicable.
        
    - Relevant **literature** and best practices.
	We are also developing the capacity to generated event/community specific schema to enable robustness and verifiability of contributions made - *creating value records*.  

## **The Rhythm of Tracking**

Data collection is woven into the natural rhythm of the engagement through various touchpoints.

- **Daily Cycles:** Brief morning intentions and evening reflections.
    
- **Weekly Circles:** Facilitated group sense-making sessions to identify patterns.
    
- **Activity Debriefs:** Structured reflection immediately following a key activity.
    
- **Field Observations:** Specialized prompts during immersive, place-based experiences.
    

By continuously tracking these multi-layered data streams, we build a living map of how value is created, exchanged, and transformed, setting the stage for the final phase of enabling stewardship.
