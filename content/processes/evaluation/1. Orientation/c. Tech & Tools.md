# Technology & Tools

Our evaluation methodology is powered by a suite of technological tools designed to capture, process, and visualize the flow of multiple forms of capital throughout an action-learning journey. These tools work together to create a seamless evaluation experience that balances ease of use with analytical depth.

## Telegram Bot Spec & Conversation Flows

At the heart of our data collection system is a Telegram bot designed to capture reflections, observations, and attributions in accessible, low-friction ways:

## Bot Capabilities

- **Voice Note Processing**: Records, transcribes, and analyzes voice reflections
    
- **Text Input Analysis**: Processes written reflections with natural language processing
    
- **Tagging System**: Supports both explicit and AI-inferred tagging
    
- **Scheduled Prompts**: Delivers contextual reflection prompts at key moments
    
- **Peer Attribution**: Enables acknowledgment of value received from others
    

## Conversation Flow Examples

**Morning Intention Prompt**:

text

`Good morning! What forms of capital do you hope to generate or receive today? [Voice note option] [Text input option] [Quick reply buttons for common capitals]`

**Evening Reflection Prompt**:

text

`As you reflect on today: 1. What was the most valuable exchange you experienced? 2. Who contributed meaningfully to your learning? 3. What surprised you about how value flowed today? [Voice note option] [Text input option] [Capital flow tagging suggestions]`

**Peer Attribution Flow**:

text

`You mentioned @username contributed to your learning. Would you like to acknowledge this contribution? [Yes/No] → If Yes:    What form of capital did they share with you?   [Social] [Human] [Natural] [Cultural] [Other]   How significant was this contribution? (1-5)`

## Data Repositories & Pipelines

The data collected through the Telegram bot and other sources flows through a structured pipeline designed for both security and accessibility:

## Primary Repository Structure

- **Raw Data Storage**: Secure database for all unprocessed inputs
    
- **Processed Data Layer**: Tagged and classified data ready for analysis
    
- **Visualization Data**: Pre-processed datasets optimized for dashboard displays
    
- **Historical Archive**: Long-term storage of evaluation data for longitudinal analysis
    

## Data Pipeline Flow

1. **Collection**: Inputs gathered from Telegram, surveys, programmatic sources
    
2. **Processing**: NLP analysis, tagging, classification, and validation
    
3. **Storage**: Structured database organization with appropriate access controls
    
4. **Analysis**: Pattern recognition, network mapping, and insight generation
    
5. **Visualization**: Transformation into interactive visual formats
    
6. **Feedback**: Insights delivered back to participants and facilitators
    

## Technical Implementation Options

- **Lightweight Option**: Airtable + Zapier + Google Sheets
    
- **Medium Option**: MongoDB + Python processing + Tableau
    
- **Full-Featured Option**: PostgreSQL + custom API + D3.js visualizations
    

## Dashboards & Visualization Guidelines

Our visualization approach makes complex capital flows accessible and actionable:

## Dashboard Components

- **Network View**: Interactive graph showing relationships between participants and capital flows
    
- **Timeline View**: Chronological display of capital flows throughout the journey
    
- **Heatmap View**: Intensity visualization of different capital types across aspects
    
- **Individual View**: Personal capital contribution and reception patterns
    
- **System View**: Macro-level patterns across the five systemic spheres
    

## Visualization Principles

1. **Clarity First**: Prioritize clear communication over visual complexity
    
2. **Interactive Depth**: Allow users to explore data at multiple levels of detail
    
3. **Contextual Comparison**: Show data in relation to baselines and sustainability norms
    
4. **Narrative Integration**: Connect quantitative patterns to qualitative stories
    
5. **Accessible Design**: Ensure visualizations are understandable by non-technical users

`Data → Processing Pipeline → Visualization Layer → Interactive Dashboard`

The dashboard updates in near real-time as new data flows in, providing a living picture of the evaluation landscape throughout the action-learning journey.

By integrating these technological tools into a cohesive system, we create an evaluation infrastructure that makes visible the often-invisible flows of value that drive regenerative development, while keeping the human experience at the center of the process.
