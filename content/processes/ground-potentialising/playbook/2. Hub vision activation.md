A **hub** is a key nodal actor in its region—an entity or practitioner deeply embedded in a [place](/glossary/Place.md) and connected to its people, ecosystems, and ongoing initiatives. The hub serves as both a grounding force and a catalyst, holding the vision for what is _possible_ rather than just reacting to problems. This step is about working with the hub to activate a **regenerative design lens**, recognizing place as a living system full of untapped potential.

## Identifying a Hub

- Look for a **community-embedded practitioner** or an organization, such as a **community center, local initiative, or place-based network**, that already plays a connective role.
- The ideal hub has **relational depth**—trusted connections with diverse actors in the community—and the ability to **coordinate across different scales** (local, regional, systemic).

## Seeing Place as a Living System

- Support the hub in **adopting a "nested systems" perspective**, recognizing how their place is interconnected with larger social, ecological, and economic flows.
- Shift from **problem-based thinking** (fixing what’s broken) to **potential-based thinking** (activating what wants to emerge).
- Use **systems mapping, storytelling, or embodied [practice](/glossary/Practice.md)** to surface unseen connections and regenerative opportunities.

## Identifying Place-Sourced Potential

- Work with the hub to **see beyond immediate challenges** and uncover **emerging opportunities for transformation**.
- Ask: What unique strengths, relationships, and resources already exist here? What new patterns or experiments could emerge?
- This step is about **revealing what the place is calling for**, rather than imposing external solutions.

## Clarifying the Hub’s Role in Realizing Potential

- Once the potential is recognized, explore **how the hub can best serve as an enabler of change**.
- This could involve **bridging relationships, hosting spaces for co-creation, testing regenerative models, or amplifying local knowledge**.

## Seeing the Hub’s Unique Contribution

- As the hub clarifies its role, it will begin to see the **specific contribution it is called to make** within the wider system.
- This contribution should be **aligned with the hub’s existing capacities**, but also stretch into new possibilities for self-organizing, collaboration, and systemic impact.

A contribution may take many forms. This needs to be something that comes from the heart of those working most committed and carefully with the essence of a place. It might be to reconnect two communities with broken history. It could be to introduce a new project that would help unblock energy and open up new directions. It could be to bring innovation and arts into a community losing young talent to foreign job markets. It could be to steer a river to steward its health long into the future.
