## **Purpose & Philosophy** 

**Why use this form?**  

- **Alignment First:** The biggest risk in past journeys was misalignment on vision, ownership, and accountability. This form is designed to surface those issues early, before any partnership is formalized.

- **Priming for Partnership:** The questions are not just for screening; they also prime the hub to reflect on their own governance, culture, and needs, setting the tone for a co-creative relationship.

- **Functional Mapping:** Each area of inquiry maps directly to a functional need for Prisma/ALJ role holders (Evaluation, Infrastructuring, Enactment, Ground Potentialization, Enrollment).

## **Design Principles**

- **Short, Direct Answers:** Level 1 is about clarity and fit—brevity is required. Optional prompts allow for more detail if the hub is eager to share.

- **Stage-Gated:** Only the minimum info needed for onboarding is collected here. Deeper questions (e.g., co-creation, long-term collaboration) are reserved for later stages.

- **Contextualization:** The form is designed to reveal what truly matters to the hub, so ALJ can center their frameworks around local priorities, not impose external agendas.

- **Red Flag Detection:** Questions about decision-making, accountability, and openness to tech are intended to surface potential friction points (e.g., ego, territoriality, resistance to change).

- **Mutuality:** The form asks "what do you need help with?" and "what would you not want?"—inviting honesty and mutual design, not just a one-way application.

## **How It Serves the Enrollment Process**  

- **Level 1 (Screening):** Is this hub a good fit for ALJ/Prisma? Are there obvious misalignments or risks? If yes, proceed to Level 2.

- **Level 2 (Service Readiness):** Can we actually serve them now? What capacities or resources would be required?

- **Level 3 (Co-Creation):** Are we ready to design a journey together? What shared infrastructure or processes are needed?

- **Level 4 (Long-Term Collaboration):** What does a sustainable, evolving partnership look like? How do we support each other’s missions over time?
## **Why This Approach?**

  - **Prevents repeating past mistakes** (ego clashes, contractor mentality, unclear roles)

- **Centers the hub’s mission** so ALJ is amplifying, not extracting or overriding

- **Creates a foundation for trust and accountability** by being explicit about governance, culture, and boundaries from the start

- **Saves time** by filtering out misaligned partners early, focusing energy on those who are truly ready to co-create
