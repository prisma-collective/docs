# **Resources & Evidence: Our Methodology in Action**

This is where our evaluation philosophy and methodology become tangible. While the previous sections explained the 'Why' and 'How' of our approach, this folder provides the 'What'—the practical tools, guides, and real-world examples you need to put our framework into practice.

This is not just a library of assets; it is a toolkit for co-creation and a repository of evidence demonstrating how our evaluation process catalyzes value flow in living systems.

## **What You'll Find Inside**

This section is organized to provide you with a clear pathway from tools to evidence.

1. **[Tooling - Our Tech Stack](obsidian://open?vault=New&file=content%2Fprocesses%2Fevaluation%2F3.%20Resources%20%26%20Evidence%2Fa.%20Tooling)**  
    A look under the hood at the technological infrastructure that enables our work, from real-time data capture to AI-assisted sense-making.
    
2. **[Templates & Guides](obsidian://open?vault=New&file=content%2Fprocesses%2Fevaluation%2F3.%20Resources%20%26%20Evidence%2Fb.%20Templates%20%26%20Guides)**  
    A curated collection of our most effective canvases, templates, and workshop agendas for facilitating the three phases of our evaluation methodology.
    
3. **[Case Study - Accra ALJ](obsidian://open?vault=New&file=content%2Fprocesses%2Fevaluation%2F3.%20Resources%20%26%20Evidence%2Fc.%20Accra%20ALJ)**  
    A detailed, transparent walkthrough of our methodology as applied during the Accra Action Learning Journey. This case study serves as powerful proof of the framework's ability to adapt to a specific context and deliver meaningful results.
    

## **A Living Toolkit**

These resources are designed to be adapted, not just applied. They are the living embodiment of our commitment to an evaluation practice that evolves through implementation. As you use, adapt, and innovate with these tools, you contribute to the ongoing development of our collective capacity to see and steward value.
