The purpose of this page is to assist with starting to write to the prisma docs. Care will be given to account for some different starting positions. In short, this is an onboarding/ orientation process. 

1. Onboarding for the first time. This is your first time in this context and you want to make your first commit.
2. Already onboarded, but you find yourself in a strange and unfamiliar state.
3. You've maxed out the basics and you want to take your publishing to the next level.

To keep things succinct, we'll call these different paths arriving, re-orienting, and levelling up, respectively. 
# Arriving
If you'd like to write to the docs, we have adopted obsidian as a client interface. Cloning the repository will pull an obsidian workspace file that includes an

	- I want to write code, not just markdown. Where do I begin? 
	- How can I modify the look and feel of the site as a whole? 
- Tech support overhead is growing. How can we make collaborative writing more reliable? 
- What's the role of publishing and the `docs` repo in the context of an [ALJ](ALJ) and/ or [prisma](prisma)?
