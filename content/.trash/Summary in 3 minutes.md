How are we going to be in beneficial relationship with AI without growing our bandwidth for how we're in relationship with each other? 

How 

5 sections: context, why, how, what, when

key takeaway (remind at the end): 
1. how powerful of an application this is
2. the kind of data that we're generating, and 
3. what that means for the questions we can ask about the development of BGI

Context
- We're prisma
- We organise action-learning journeys. 
	- An action-learning journey is an event. 
	- Think of them as a facilitated hackathon that lasts multiple weeks and happens at the end of multiple months of alignment between different kinds of stakeholders. 
	- It's a multi-disciplinary intensive. 
	- Every event is essentially an experiment in applying social technology. 
- Action-learning
	- The action is 
		- design and implement a systemic intervention in the place where the hackathon is hosted
	- The learning is 
		- how thinking changes as theory is applied in the real world
- We have HUGE potential lined up
	- €20M fund kind of huge
	- Several communities of practice
	- Coming from long-term partnership work, spanning several years
- We work at the grassroots level
	- We have a focussed but growing network of partner hubs, on-the-ground
	- Bootstrapped the whole thing so far

WHY did we apply for funding for?
- In order to learn from these actions, we need 
	- to make visible not just the outcomes from these events 
	- but also the approach. 
- We make these visible in a case-study. 
	- One per action-learning journey. 
- What's in a case-study? 
	- Yes, you can have networks of IoT sensors - digital MRV from the ReFi space, or DePIN, assessing "impact"
	- That's what would conventionally be expected and we're going there, too. 
	- But, the real learning that is most important relates to how people evolve their view of the world. 
- The challenge is to make that visible
	- This has sunk many great systems-change efforts in the past
	- Systems change practitioners know that to effect change means needing to go to the root.
		- Think iceberg
		- Carbon emissions just the tip of the iceberg
		- Below the surface are beliefs, worldviews etc, and that's where real change happens
	- Working radically (lit. means "at the root") is difficult to see 
		- you work with beliefs
		- and how people approach relating with each other
- So, we need an innovative approach to try and lift to the surface more of what usually stays hidden, personal, or implicit

HOW
- To make visible thinking to a broader audience in a case-study, people first need to be able to make visible their thinking to themselves 
- How do we do that? 
	- Already existing technology of journaling
	- Journaling is already pretty boring
	- When you think of it that way, trying to make sense of journaling at the collective level sounds painstakingly tiresome
	- With voice-interface backed onto LLMs, we can access greater capabilities with the fluency of spoken word

WHAT
- We want to build a proof-of-concept that covers the full stack from event participation to presenting action-learning in an interactive case-study online. 
- We have the telegram voice-interface for journal entries
- We will soon have an operational vercel faas ingest system
- We have the front-end for presenting a timeline of the process as a whole
- We just need the embeddings of transcriptions of voice notes and the inquiry with AI into the data

When
- The next event is in May, happening in Ghana
- We're literally working with a chief in the Oti region, and the hub is part of a network of community learning hubs focussing on training youth in emerging technologies

Key takeaways:
- Everything is in place
- Why I want you to vote for us is 
	- because of the kind of data that we're generating
	- because of the ethical questions that this raises when combining AI with in-person social technology experimentation
	- because you're the community to develop with

Not inc.

- We're moving forwards whether we get this grant or not because we need to. The grant means we can do it properly and share it with your community
- Emphasis of our work is to embody processes of decentralised organising 
	- In-person intensives. 
	- There are many ways this can happen. 
	- Mostly sociocracy, so far. 
	- It's about truly activating the agency of every individual - in a group coordination exercise. This is totally transformational. 
	- E.g. A workshop was designed by one of our team on the way to a conference, here, in Barcelona. It lasted under an hour. Several months later, the same facilitator bumped into a participant of that workshop who told them that the workshop had literally changed their life. They took so many decisions on things they were previously blocked on.
