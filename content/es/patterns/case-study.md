each action-learning journey produces a story. this is a story about the application of [practice](/glossary/Practice.md) on-the-ground among networks of real people and [places](/glossary/Place.md). practice is applied to grow the capacity for evolution of these systems, so that they can work toward realising their potential and expressing their essence. 

capacity-building can happen in many different dimensions. we call these dimensions [aspects](/patterns/aspects).[^1] below is a short list of examples...

- networking
- financing
- storytelling
- law relations
- land relations
- youth engagement
- impact assessment
- fooding
- health systems

each aspect makes visible one view into the application of practice on-the-ground. we make this visible with currencies. [^2]

each case-study therefore aims to utilise one or multiple [practice-currencies](processes/process-infrastructuring/publishing/practice-currencies.mdx). this dynamic interplay between action (practice) and learning (evaluation, aided by currency), is the essence of our work at prisma.

these currencies are the verified measurements that form the foundation for data-backed storytelling. all the additional media - meeting recordings, photos, audio notes, design documents - are (qualitative) layers of additional context that give wholeness to this underlying (quantitative, yet non-transactional) heartbeat. 

1. Curation - the most polished, and also the most abstracted. see [prisma.events](https://www.prisma.events)
2. Archive - more complete, and also more raw and rugged. see [docs.prisma.events](https://docs.prisma.events)
3. Integrations - custom applications serving specific transformations. see [evaluate.prisma.events](https://evaluate.prisma.events) and [timelining](/processes/process-infrastructuring/timelining)
4. Aspects - [practice-currencies](/processes/process-infrastructuring/practice-currencies). lowest-level detail, leveraging accounts of peer-to-peer interactions

the purpose of [enrolment](/processes/enrolment) and [ground-potentialising](/processes/ground-potentialising.md), in the lead up to [action-learning journey](/patterns/action-learning%20journeys.md) intensives, is for the whole system of [place](/glossary/Place.md) to become more visible, and for a place-sourced [practice](/glossary/Practice.md) to be identified. these place-sourced practices are what animate the multi-stakeholder, multi-level [enactment](/processes/enactment), gesturing toward potential-led, place-sourced economy. 

### Purpose

case-studies serve the purpose of show-casing the work on-the-ground to a broader audience:

1. other practitioners who want to see practice being applied, to learn and integrate into how they apply practice in their own places
2. external evaluators who are looking to resource meaningful work

case-studies are an interface into [action-learning](/patterns/action-learning.md) - real-time, with multiple perspectives. in this way, the case-study is in fact an ongoing storying of expression of essence of [place](/glossary/Place.md). the potential we're aiming for is for [hubs](/collaborators/communities-of-place/hub/hubs.md) to grow their self-[publishing](processes/process-infrastructuring/publishing) capabilities. prisma's role as [a distributed incubator](/home) is to on-board more hubs into a distributed system of self-organising action-learning journeys, each hub growing their capability over time to address higher orders of outcome aims.
