# Introduction
Prisma organises transformation-oriented events. We integrate regenerative design, facilitation and innovation to create the conditions for highly participatory, engaged and emergent <span className="text-prisma-a">collective action</span>. Our events are like <span className="text-prisma-a">a new kind of hackathon</span>, and our last event took place in [Accra](/events/accra), lasting two weeks. Working with one on-the-ground hub in Accra and a partner in the Northern region, we managed to cover:

- Systems thinking and complexity
- Community outreach and intervention design
- Self-organising, leadership and roles
- Decentralised decision-making
- Values system design, leading to...
- Community-led evaluation and funding distribution
- Cardano training
- A field trip 7 hours north
- Pitch day presentations
- Professional footage of interviews with each of the team leads
- A dedicated digital commons for the hub (more below)
- 400+ queryable reflection entries, through our in-house, voice-based, participatory story-making system, which is publicly available for a limited period at [evaluate](https://evaluate.prisma.events)
- Developing three inter-disciplinary teams working on three completely different, self-identified systems. Two of these teams are now developing into fully-fledged organisations, still working on their projects almost 3 months later. The combined funding applications made since the "hackathon" are well over $100k. These are not just codebases. These are genuine pathways to greater community vitality that those teams are finding and developing for themselves. The depth and breadth of these projects is not a coincidence - it's exactly what Prisma is designed for. 

We know what we're doing. Some of the specialities we draw upon to do our work include:

- Social Movement Organising
- Social and Emotional Learning
- Software Engineering and Data Analytics
- Regenerative Design

These are not buzzwords, to us. They're fields of study which our team has been training in for several years if not decades. 

# Understanding of Needs
Cardano Africa Tech Summit (CATS) is an opportunity to show Cardano, and its extended network connections, how much build activity and technology potential there is across sub-Saharan Africa. There are several organisations involved in the organising of this event, happening February 11-13, 2026, including [Wada](https://www.wada.org), who are the principal delegate responsible for the successful delivery of the Summit as a whole. There are two primary potentials that extend beyond the completion of the summit:

1. Cardano Engagement: Emboldened Wada involvement in future Cardano projects, including more prominant governance influence
2. Projecting: Future engagements resulting from *projecting* talent and initiatives from the ground up

> The word "project" derives from "pro-" meaning forwards and "ye-" meaning throw or drive. [ref](https://www.etymonline.com/word/project)

The key detail here, from an organisational standpoint, is to recognise the Summit as a project nested within a larger system. In this way, we can bring order also to the "hackathon" programmes, delivered by Prisma, for Wada, which are one part of the larger system of the summit (see *Summit Nested Systems*). 

The "hackathon" programme is in service to amplifying the visibility of Cardano developer talent, on-the-ground, across Wada partner regions, in the form of projects. Therefore, a fourth and final organisational layer is required to be activated: the projects themselves (see *Projecting*). 

> How does this change your relationship to the use of the term "project?" If you think in terms of the capability of each team to project themselves and their work forwards onto the big stage, does that change how you frame the organising of the summit itself? What about the larger system the summit is part of? What new capabilities are we unlocking in that larger system, by delivering this summit as effectively as possible?

# Offer
We provide a [minimum viable infrastructure](/patterns/minimum-viable-infrastructure) package to select partners to organise an event. With this infrastructure and our facilitation support, we believe we can work with the hubs in the Wada network to deliver... 

    - <span className="text-prisma-a">250</span> developers engaged (plus <span className="text-prisma-a">375</span> non-developer team members)
    - <span className="text-prisma-a">50</span> viable projects, from a total of <span className="text-prisma-a">125</span> teams formed
    - <span className="text-prisma-a">100</span> developers retained for roughly 3 months

These projects will be regionally relevant, designed with regenerative principles in mind, and made possible by building a chain of facilitator capacity through the hub network coordinated by Wada.

In order to deliver this, we're going to be aiming for roughly <span className="text-prisma-a">2,500</span> initial sign-ups, and would need to run <span className="text-prisma-a">16</span> hackathons in total. How many hackathons per hub depends on how many hubs we can onboard between now and November 1st.

    Here, a margin of 0% was chosen for the number of developers because we are aiming to form inter-disciplinary teams, which will contain many additional people (<span className="text-prisma-a">375</span>) also working on Cardano-related projects, yet not strictly a developer. 

    As for the number of projects formed, a 25% margin was chosen to aim for a higher number from the outset, giving us some breathing room. There is also a strict definition of a *genuine project*, as distinct from simply a team that completed a hackathon weekend, and so the number of code repositories is in fact expected to be far higher (<span className="text-prisma-a">125</span>) than the <span className="text-prisma-a">50</span> projects referenced below.

    A margin of 20% was chosen for the number of developers retained for the same reason. However, due to the parameters involved, it was not straightforward to match the forecasted outcome with the aim. The true results have been left for transparency and to generate further discussion.

    The 3 scenarios below communicate three modes of hub-network engagement. 

    1. Many hubs (15), requiring less reach per-hub
    2. Relatively few hubs (5), requiring a greater reach per-hub
    3. The middle ground (10)

    In each case, the numbers have been derived from the same fixed aim of reaching 250 Cardano developers, and facilitating a number of hackathons to produce 50 projects. 

    The parameters used in modelling these forecasts are listed below:

In these images, the [minimum viable infrastructure](/patterns/minimum-viable-infrastructure) referred to above is indicated by the dashed red ellipse. These diagrams show the [system level](/processes/process-infrastructuring) at which the apps are deployed to, indicating which organisation is (ideally) self-hosting or (at least) managing (i.e. their own account with a cloud service provider) the apps. 

By building the chain of facilitation capacity referred to above, we will be working in alignment with the hubs to grow the incubation capacity of their hackathons. Bringing the same organisational stack to mind as before, this detail highlights the need to differentiate another level within the systems being worked on: the hubs. 

Lastly, we have built the means for processing contributions at the level of voice notes from individual participants, in a Telegram group chat, where the group chat represents an organisational context. We call this [timelining](https://evaluate.prisma.events) as it is a process of collectively and proactively creating a timeline of the process as a whole. With each hackathon being the start of teams working on transitioning their systems of place, these voice note reflections are a way to make visible the action on-the-ground, projecting the collective voice of these developers through the whole organisational stack to the summit itself.

As well as the hackathon programme design and process facilitation, this organisational capacity and infrastructure is part of the core value offering made by Prisma. Prisma is a whole system, which has been designed to bridge social and technical to facilitate aligned collective action, from the ground up.
