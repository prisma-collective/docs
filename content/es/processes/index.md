# Core Processes
at the highest level, each event is the interplay of the following four processes. these processes each receive a sub-domain dedicated to engaging a wider audience with the inner workings of the event. these sub-domains become the endpoints by which [hubs](/collaborators/communities-of-place/hub/hubs.md) can integrate their [place](/glossary/Place.md)-unique interfaces into working with the essence of place in a global-scale, self-evolving platform.

1. [enrolment](/processes/enrolment) 
	- stakeholder engagement
	- participant, practice and systems onboarding
2. [ground-potentialising](/processes/ground-potentialising.md) 
	- fostering relational depth
	- accumulating intention
	- imaging place-sourced potential (hubs platforming local network activity)
3. [enacting](/processes/enactment) 
	- [practice](/glossary/Practice.md) embodiment
	- learning by doing
	- organisation forming
4. [evaluating](/processes/evaluation)
	- shifting systems [flows](https://metacurrency.org/faq/#qaef-1035)
	- making visible the effects of systems interventions 
	- reflecting on the approach, harvesting learnings, integrating into practice evolution

we will aim to automate the registering and configuring of sub-domains, minimum viable service/ api deployments and testing, and porting back into a global visibility mapping interface. these endpoints are the means for communicating activity on-the-ground and the stem for each event-specific code repository.
