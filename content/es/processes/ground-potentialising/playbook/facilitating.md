Once the hub and facilitation team are in place, the next step is to design and employ **[place](/glossary/Place.md)-specific versions** of the four core facilitation processes. Each process corresponds to a key facilitator role and serves as a guiding structure for channelling energy into the **Action Learning Journey (ALJ) intensive**—the multi-stakeholder container for aligned, emergent action.

## Enrolment: Aligning Energies Around Potential

- The **hub and facilitator teams** steward the process of inviting additional participants, ensuring that diverse capacities (roles) align with the **vision of potential** emerging through the ALJ.
- This is more than recruitment—it’s about **intentional weaving** of relationships, ensuring that each participant plays a meaningful part in realizing the system’s potential.

## Ground-Potentializing: Managing Scope & Readiness

- This process ensures that **expectations are balanced** between on-the-ground realities and the larger vision.
- The hub and facilitation teams work to:
    - **Define a clear focus** for the ALJ.
    - **Ensure alignment between approach and intended outcomes.**
    - **Engage external stakeholders** whose interests connect to the envisioned outcomes.
- This step **contains the ALJ scope**, preventing it from becoming too diffuse while still allowing for emergence.

## Action: Designing for Self-Organizing Emergence

- The facilitation team **creates conditions** for participants to engage in **self-organizing action** that leads to a tangible **innovation, prototype, or intervention**.
- This process is:
    - **Informed by the unique place-based context** and its dynamics.
    - **Designed from a living systems paradigm**, where the experience itself becomes the experiment.
    - **Focused on embodiment and experiential learning**—participants don’t just discuss, they enact and inhabit a **potential system state** in real time.
- The collective insights from this phase drive a **precise, emergent intervention**.

## Evaluation: Making Flows of Energy Visible & Valued

- Rather than standard metrics, this process tracks **how energy moves through the ALJ**—what is activated, where value is created, and how it continues beyond the event.
- The facilitation team makes visible:
    - **The new relationships, insights, and capacities formed.**
    - **The shifts in perspective or [practice](/glossary/Practice.md) that emerge.**
    - **The regenerative potential seeded in the place.**
- This ensures that the ALJ **leaves a lasting imprint**, not just in actions taken but in **new ways of being and working that sustain beyond the event**.
