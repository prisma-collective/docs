# 🇳🇬 About the Abuja Hub

## Purpose

The Abuja Hub exists to create a grounded and supportive environment where innovators explore real community realities within Abuja and its surrounding areas, and work on problems rooted in local context and lived experience.

In a city shaped by diversity, governance, and constant movement, the hub encourages teams to look closely at everyday challenges and transform insight into practical, meaningful, and regenerative technological solutions.

> "No matter how far the stream flows, it never forgets its source."

The Abuja Hub is built on this principle — innovation that stays connected to its people.

## Vision

To grow a resilient innovation community in Abuja—one that listens carefully to local needs, honours community voices, and enables young builders to design solutions that strengthen social, economic, civic, and institutional systems across Nigeria.

## Mission

To guide teams through a structured but human-centred process that combines:

- Community exploration within Abuja
- Technical and design skill-building
- Collaboration and peer learning
- Prototype development and clear documentation

The mission is simple: ensure every team in the Abuja Hub has the clarity, support, and mentorship needed to deliver work grounded in real community insight and lived realities.

# 📅 Hub Schedule & Key Activities

The Abuja Hub follows a clear and intentional progression:

**exploration → sense-making → design → prototyping → final submission**

Each phase includes:

- Clearly defined expectations
- Review and reflection checkpoints
- Documentation and learning requirements

Teams are expected to show meaningful progress at every stage — not just in code or design, but in depth of understanding and alignment with community needs.
