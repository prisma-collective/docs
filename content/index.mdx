prisma is a distributed [action-learning](/patterns/action-learning.md) incubator. we organise and facilitate action-learning journeys, <FeatureText text="ALJ" className="text-lg cursor-pointer" href="/patterns/action-learning%20journeys" />s, so that [bioregional](/glossary/bioregion) communities can participate more fully in transition pathways toward life-affirming futures. we work at three levels of incubation:

<Steps>
  ### Case
  action-learning journeys generate [place](/glossary/Place.md)-sourced, time-bound expressions of system change, documented as a case-study. Prisma <FeatureText text="CASE" className="text-lg cursor-pointer" href="/patterns/case-study" colorSelections={[4,5]} /> makes visible the real-world application of [practice](/glossary/Practice) with the grammatical capacities of [practice-currencies](/processes/process-infrastructuring/practice-currencies.mdx), co-designed with, by and for communities on-the-ground.
  
  ### Form
  we incubate self-organising action-learning teams by supporting their transition into digitally-coordinated entities rooted in real-world alignment. these practice-DAOs emerge from the commitments, agreements, and governance protocols developed during action-learning journeys.
  
  ### Pathways
  ecosystems are composed of hubs, partner institutions, field-builders, and aligned funders. at this level, we facilitate the integration of multiple domains of coordination—economic, legal, narrative, ecological—through patterns of decentralised organising, network weaving, and infrastructure co-design. each ecosystem becomes a learning system, capable of evolving its own enabling environment.
