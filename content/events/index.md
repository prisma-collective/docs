# Software License and Deployment Agreement

Effective upon digital acceptance (“Deploy” action)
Between Prisma (“Licensor”) and each verified deployment participant or organization (“Licensee”).

# Recitals and Context

Whereas, Prisma supports a network of partner hubs in developing an economy of applications that enable participation in and communication of evolving local systems;

Whereas, these hubs operate autonomously within their own contexts, values, and partnerships, and Prisma’s goal is to provide a “narrative infrastructure”—a publishing framework empowering hubs to express themselves freely and coordinate resources without compromising integrity;

Whereas, as part of these capabilities, Prisma provides a Publishing Stack—a modular suite of applications supporting participatory processes, deployed to partner hubs’ own cloud instances in alignment with the principles of decentralisation and digital sovereignty;

Whereas, to enable this open, collaborative, and transparent model while preserving the security and integrity of Prisma’s systems and intellectual property, the following license governs access and deployment of the software;

Now, therefore, the parties agree as follows:

## 1. Purpose and Grant

Licensor provides access to the Prisma Publishing Stack (and related modules, tools, and infrastructure) for the purpose of enabling participation, publication, and coordination within the specific event, initiative, or workflow context defined in the deployment metadata recorded at the time of acceptance.

Licensor grants Licensee a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-sublicensable license to deploy and operate the software solely within this dynamically defined context.
All other uses are prohibited.

## 2. Deployment Conditions

1. At the time of each deployment, the system collects immutable metadata including (without limitation):

* Wallet address and verified identity of Licensee;
* Event or project name, date range, and identifiers;
* Domain/subdomain configuration;
* Software modules and repositories deployed;
* Platform identifiers (e.g., GitHub, Vercel, or equivalent);
* Timestamp and deployment status.

2. Such metadata shall be automatically incorporated by reference into this Agreement as Schedule A for that specific deployment, and forms part of the legally binding contract between Licensor and Licensee.
3. Each deployment record constitutes a distinct contract instance, binding solely for the defined workflow, project, or event.
4. Any reuse, modification, or redeployment outside the recorded context requires a new acceptance and corresponding metadata capture.

## 3. Intellectual Property

All rights, title, and interest in and to the Prisma Publishing Stack—including source code, documentation, algorithms, and design—remain the exclusive property of Licensor.
Licensee receives no ownership, title, or derivative rights.
Licensee may not reverse-engineer, copy, adapt, or redistribute the software, or make it publicly available under open-source or similar licenses without prior written approval.

## 4. Data, Security, and Transparency

1. Licensee acknowledges that Licensor may record deployment metadata (including wallet address, timestamp, event name, and T&Cs hash) and may anchor authorship or deployment records to a public blockchain for verification purposes.
2. Licensee shall comply with all applicable data protection laws and implement reasonable safeguards to prevent unauthorized disclosure or alteration of the software or related data.
3. Licensor may store deployment metadata, including this Agreement’s cryptographic hash, within an immutable database, ledger, or blockchain-based registry. This record shall constitute the definitive version of the Agreement for evidentiary purposes.

## 5. Attribution

A non-prominent “Powered by Prisma” notice or digital attribution may appear within the deployed system and related metadata. Licensee may not remove or obscure it.

## 6. Termination and Revocation

Licensor may revoke or suspend Licensee’s deployment rights immediately if Licensee:

* Misuses the software, breaches these terms, or fails to maintain security controls;
* Attempts to deploy or modify the software outside authorized channels; or
* Ceases participation in the associated event.

Upon termination, Licensee must cease all use of the software and delete all copies.

## 7. Limitation of Liability

Except for willful misconduct or gross negligence, Licensor shall not be liable for indirect, incidental, or consequential damages arising from use or inability to use the software.

## 8. Governing Law and Jurisdiction

This Agreement shall be governed by the laws of [insert jurisdiction, e.g., Germany or England & Wales], and any disputes shall be resolved before the competent courts of [insert city].

## 9. Digital Acceptance

By selecting “Deploy,” connecting a verified Cardano wallet, and signing the deployment nonce, the Licensee:

* Confirms identity and authority to act for the corresponding organization;
* Agrees that such digital signature constitutes a legally binding acceptance under applicable electronic-signature laws; and
* Accepts all terms of this Agreement as of the deployment timestamp.
