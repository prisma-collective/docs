Living Labs are experimental spaces, often situated within communities, where new ideas, technologies, and approaches to social and environmental challenges are tested in real-world settings. These labs bring together local stakeholders—such as residents, researchers, businesses, and policymakers—to collaborate on solutions that are designed to work within the specific social and ecological dynamics of the area. The aim is to create iterative, flexible solutions that are adapted to local needs and can be scaled or refined over time.

This perspective opens up opportunities to trial innovative models of social organization, such as DAOs (decentralized autonomous organizations) or Teal organizations. DAOs are built on decentralization and shared governance through blockchain, while Teal organizations empower members through shared purpose, self-management, and flexibility. Bioregional living labs act as sandboxes for experimenting with these approaches, replicating natural ecosystems where self-organization and collective intelligence drive adaptability and diversity. In these living labs, communities can explore organizational structures that reflect the layered and interdependent nature of living systems, discovering new ways toward sustainable, resilient living that are attuned to their specific ecological and cultural contexts.
