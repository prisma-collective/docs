**Developmental evaluation**, as articulated by **Michael Quinn Patton**, is uniquely suited to environments characterized by **innovation, complexity, and emergence**—exactly the kind of environments your methodology engages. DE is designed to support social innovation and transformative change processes, helping practitioners **learn, adapt**, and **evolve strategies** in real-time. Instead of simply measuring predetermined outcomes, DE focuses on **tracking emergent patterns**, **understanding dynamic shifts**, and **informing adaptive decision-making**.

Here are some of the main reasons we're integrating DE in this line of work:

1. Navigating Emergence and Complexity
1. Fostering Learning and Adaptation
1. Capturing Multiple Forms of Value
1. Supporting Systems Innovation and Transformation
1. Adaptive Measurement of Success
